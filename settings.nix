This button must be on the same physical device as the pointer, according to libinput docs. The type is a button code, as defined in [`input-event-codes.h`](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/e42b1a9a2557aa94fee47f078633677198386a52/include/uapi/linux/input-event-codes.h#L355-L363). Most commonly, this will be set to `BTN_LEFT`, `BTN_MIDDLE`, or `BTN_RIGHT`, or at least some mouse button, but any button from that file is a valid value for this option (though, libinput may not necessarily do anything useful with most of them)

              the three vertical windows look identical, with a yellow and red corner, and the other two corners are slightly different shades of orange.
              the big window has a yellow and red corner, with the top left corner being a very red orange orange, and the bottom right corner being a very yellow orange.
              the top edge of the top stacked window has a noticeable transition from a yellowish orange to completely red.

              If the gradient is instead `relative-to` the `"workspace-view"`, then the gradient will start and stop at the bounds of your view. Windows decorations will take on the color values from just the part of the screen that they occupy

              it looks like the gradient starts in the bottom left of the big window, and ends in the top right of the upper stacked window.
              the bottom left corner of the top stacked window is a red orange color, and the bottom left corner of the middle stacked window is a more neutral orange color.
              the bottom edge of the big window is almost entirely yellow, and the top edge of the top stacked window is almost entirely red.

              The active-in-column window is the window that was last focused in that column. When you switch focus to a column, the active-in-column window will be the new focused window.

              A note on terminology used here: a window is actually a toplevel surface, and a surface just refers to any rectangular region that a client can draw to. A toplevel surface is just a surface with additional capabilities and properties (e.g. "fullscreen", "resizable", "min size", etc)

              For a window to be focused, its surface must be focused. There is up to one focused surface, and it is the surface that can receive keyboard input. There can never be more than one focused surface. There can be zero focused surfaces if and only if there are zero surfaces. The focused surface does *not* have to be a toplevel surface. It can also be a layer-shell surface. In that case, there is a surface with keyboard focus but no *window* with keyboard focus.

        ${Surface-rules}.

        A ${surface-rule} will match based on ${link' "programs.niri.settings.${option}.*.matches"} and ${link' "programs.niri.settings.${option}.*.excludes"}. Both of these are lists of "match rules".

        A given match rule can match based on one of several fields. For a given match rule to "match" a ${surface}, it must match on all fields.

        ${example-fields}

        - The `at_startup` field, when non-null, will match a ${surface} based on whether it was opened within the first 60 seconds of niri starting up.

        - If a field is null, it will always match.

        For a given ${surface-rule} to match a ${surface}, the above logic is employed to determine whether any given match rule matches, and the interactions between the match rules decide whether the ${surface-rule} as a whole will match. For a given ${surface-rule}:

        - A given ${surface} is "considered" if any of the match rules in ${link' "programs.niri.settings.${option}.*.matches"} successfully match this ${surface}. If all of the match rules do not match this ${surface}, then that ${surface} will never match this ${surface-rule}.

        - If ${link' "programs.niri.settings.${option}.*.matches"} contains no match rules, it will match any ${surface} and "consider" it for this ${surface-rule}.

        - If a given ${surface} is "considered" for this ${surface-rule} according to the above rules, the selection can be further refined with ${link' "programs.niri.settings.${option}.*.excludes"}. If any of the match rules in `excludes` match this ${surface}, it will be rejected and this ${surface-rule} will not match the given ${surface}.

        That is, a given ${surface-rule} will apply to a given ${surface} if any of the entries in ${link' "programs.niri.settings.${option}.*.matches"} match that ${surface} (or there are none), AND none of the entries in ${link' "programs.niri.settings.${option}.*.excludes"} match that ${surface}.

        All fields of a ${surface-rule} can be set to null, which represents that the field shall have no effect on the ${surface} (and in general, the client is allowed to choose the initial value).

        To compute the final set of ${surface-rule}s that apply to a given ${surface}, each ${surface-rule} in this list is consdered in order.

        At first, every field is set to null.

        Then, for each applicable ${surface-rule}:

        - If a given field is null on this ${surface-rule}, it has no effect. It does nothing and "inherits" the value from the previous rule.
        - If the given field is not null, it will overwrite the value from any previous rule.

        The "final value" of a field is simply its value at the end of this process. That is, the final value of a field is the one from the *last* ${surface-rule} that matches the given ${surface-rule} (not considering null entries, unless there are no non-null entries)

        If the final value of a given field is null, then it usually means that the client gets to decide. For more information, see the documentation for each field.
      '';

      match = ''
        A list of rules to match ${surfaces}.

        If any of these rules match a ${surface} (or there are none), that ${surface-rule} will be considered for this ${surface}. It can still be rejected by ${link' "programs.niri.settings.${option}.*.excludes"}

        If all of the rules do not match a ${surface}, then this ${surface-rule} will not apply to that ${surface}.
      '';

      exclude = ''
        A list of rules to exclude ${surfaces}.

        If any of these rules match a ${surface}, then this ${surface-rule} will not apply to that ${surface}, even if it matches one of the rules in ${link' "programs.niri.settings.${option}.*.matches"}

        If none of these rules match a ${surface}, then this ${surface-rule} will not be rejected. It will apply to that ${surface} if and only if it matches one of the rules in ${link' "programs.niri.settings.${option}.*.matches"}
      '';

      match-at-startup = ''
        When true, this rule will match ${surfaces} opened within the first 60 seconds of niri starting up. When false, this rule will match ${surfaces} opened *more than* 60 seconds after niri started up. This is useful for applying different rules to ${surfaces} opened from ${link' "programs.niri.settings.spawn-at-startup"} versus those opened later.
      '';

      opacity = ''
        The opacity of the ${surface}, ranging from 0 to 1.

        If the final value of this field is null, niri will fall back to a value of 1.

        Note that this is applied in addition to the opacity set by the client. Setting this to a semitransparent value on a ${surface} that is already semitransparent will make it even more transparent.
      '';

      block-out-from = ''
        Whether to block out this ${surface} from screen captures. When the final value of this field is null, it is not blocked out from screen captures.

        This is useful to protect sensitive information, like the contents of password managers or private chats. It is very important to understand the implications of this option, as described below, **especially if you are a streamer or content creator**.

        Some of this may be obvious, but in general, these invariants *should* hold true:
        - a ${surface} is never meant to be blocked out from the actual physical screen (otherwise you wouldn't be able to see it at all)
        - a `block-out-from` ${surface} *is* meant to be always blocked out from screencasts (as they are often used for livestreaming etc)
        - a `block-out-from` ${surface} is *not* supposed to be blocked from screenshots (because usually these are not broadcasted live, and you generally know what you're taking a screenshot of)

        There are three methods of screencapture in niri:

        1. The `org.freedesktop.portal.ScreenCast` interface, which is used by tools like OBS primarily to capture video. When `block-out-from = "screencast";` or `block-out-from = "screen-capture";`, this ${surface} is blocked out from the screencast portal, and will not be visible to screencasting software making use of the screencast portal.

        1. The `wlr-screencopy` protocol, which is used by tools like `grim` primarily to capture screenshots. When `block-out-from = "screencast";`, this protocol is not affected and tools like `grim` can still capture the ${surface} just fine. This is because you may still want to take a screenshot of such ${surfaces}. However, some screenshot tools display a fullscreen overlay with a frozen image of the screen, and then capture that. This overlay is *not* blocked out in the same way, and may leak the ${surface} contents to an active screencast. When `block-out-from = "screen-capture";`, this ${surface} is blocked out from `wlr-screencopy` and thus will never leak in such a case, but of course it will always be blocked out from screenshots and (sometimes) the physical screen.

        1. The built in `screenshot` action, implemented in niri itself. This tool works similarly to those based on `wlr-screencopy`, but being a part of the compositor gets superpowers regarding secrecy of ${surface} contents. Its frozen overlay will never leak ${surface} contents to an active screencast, because information of blocked ${surfaces} and can be distinguished for the physical output and screencasts. `block-out-from` does not affect the built in screenshot tool at all, and you can always take a screenshot of any ${surface}.

        | `block-out-from` | can `ScreenCast`? | can `screencopy`? | can `screenshot`? |
        | --- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
        | `null` | yes | yes | yes |
        | `"screencast"` | no | yes | yes |
        | `"screen-capture"` | no | no | yes |

        > [!caution]
        > **Streamers: Do not accidentally leak ${surface} contents via screenshots.**
        >
        > For ${surfaces} where `block-out-from = "screencast";`, contents of a ${surface} may still be visible in a screencast, if the ${surface} is indirectly displayed by a tool using `wlr-screencopy`.
        >
        > If you are a streamer, either:
        > - make sure not to use `wlr-screencopy` tools that display a preview during your stream, or
        > - **set `block-out-from = "screen-capture";` to ensure that the ${surface} is never visible in a screencast.**

        > [!caution]
        > **Do not let malicious `wlr-screencopy` clients capture your top secret ${surfaces}.**

        >
        > For ${surfaces} where `block-out-from = "screencast";`, contents of a ${surface} will still be visible to any application using `wlr-screencopy`, even if you did not consent to this application capturing your screen.
        >
        > Note that sandboxed clients restricted via security context (i.e. Flatpaks) do not have access to `wlr-screencopy` at all, and are not a concern.
        >
        > **If a ${surface}'s contents are so secret that they must never be captured by any (non-sandboxed) application, set `block-out-from = "screen-capture";`.**

        Essentially, use `block-out-from = "screen-capture";` if you want to be sure that the ${surface} is never visible to any external tool no matter what; or use `block-out-from = "screencast";` if you want to be able to capture screenshots of the ${surface} without its contents normally being visible in a screencast. (at the risk of some tools still leaking the ${surface} contents, see above)

                  - `{hidden = true;}` will emit `hotkey-overlay-title=null` in the KDL config, and the hotkey overlay will not contain this keybind at all.
                  - `{title = "foo";}` will emit `hotkey-overlay-title="foo"` in the KDL config, and the hotkey overlay will show "foo" as the title of this keybind.
                '';
              };
            action =
              required (newtype (plain-type "niri action") kdl.types.kdl-leaf)
              // {
                description = ''
                  An action is represented as an attrset with a single key, being the name, and a value that is a list of its arguments. For example, to represent a spawn action, you could do this:

                  ```nix
                  {
                    programs.niri.settings.binds = {
                      "XF86AudioRaiseVolume".action.spawn = ["wpctl" "set-volume" "@DEFAULT_AUDIO_SINK@" "0.1+"];
                      "XF86AudioLowerVolume".action.spawn = ["wpctl" "set-volume" "@DEFAULT_AUDIO_SINK@" "0.1-"];
                    };
                  }
                  ```

                  If there is only a single argument, you can pass it directly. It will be implicitly converted to a list in that case.

                  ```nix
                  {
                    programs.niri.settings.binds = {
                      "Mod+D".action.spawn = "fuzzel";
                      "Mod+1".action.focus-workspace = 1;
                    };
                  }
                  ```

                  For actions taking properties (named arguments), you can pass an attrset.

                  ```nix
                  {
                    programs.niri.settings.binds = {
                      "Mod+Shift+E".action.quit.skip-confirmation = true;
                    };
                  }
                  ```

                  There is also a set of functions available under `config.lib.niri.actions`.

                  Usage is like so:

                  ```nix
                  {
                    programs.niri.settings.binds = with config.lib.niri.actions; {
                      "XF86AudioRaiseVolume".action = spawn "wpctl" "set-volume" "@DEFAULT_AUDIO_SINK@" "0.1+";
                      "XF86AudioLowerVolume".action = spawn "wpctl" "set-volume" "@DEFAULT_AUDIO_SINK@" "0.1-";

                      "Mod+D".action = spawn "fuzzel";
                      "Mod+1".action = focus-workspace 1;

                      "Mod+Shift+E".action = quit;
                      "Mod+Ctrl+Shift+E".action = quit { skip-confirmation=true; };

                      "Mod+Plus".action = set-column-width "+10%";
                    }
                  }
                  ```

                  Keep in mind that each one of these attributes (i.e. the nix bindings) are actually identical functions with different node names, and they can take arbitrarily many arguments. The documentation here is based on the *real* acceptable arguments for these actions, but the nix bindings do not enforce this. If you pass the wrong arguments, niri will reject the config file, but evaluation will proceed without problems.

                  For actions that don't take any arguments, just use the corresponding attribute from `config.lib.niri.actions`. They are listed as `action-name`. For actions that *do* take arguments, they are notated like so: `λ action-name :: <args>`, to clarify that they "should" be used as functions. Hopefully, `<args>` will be clear enough in most cases, but it's worth noting some nontrivial kinds of arguments:

                  - `size-change`: This is a special argument type used for some actions by niri. It's a string. \
                    It can take either a fixed size as an integer number of logical pixels (`"480"`, `"1200"`) or a proportion of your screen as a percentage (`"30%"`, `"70%"`) \
                    Additionally, it can either be an absolute change (setting the new size of the window), or a relative change (adding or subtracting from its size). \
                    Relative size changes are written with a `+`/`-` prefix, and absolute size changes have no prefix.

                  - `{ field :: type }`: This means that the action takes a named argument (in kdl, we call it a property). \
                    To pass such an argument, you should pass an attrset with the key and value. You can pass many properties in one attrset, or you can pass several attrsets with different properties. \
                    Required fields are marked with `*` before their name, and if no fields are required, you can use the action without any arguments too (see `quit` in the example above). \
                    If a field is marked with `?`, then omitting it is meaningful. (without `?`, it will have a default value)

                  - `[type]`: This means that the action takes several arguments as a list. Although you can pass a list directly, it's more common to pass them as separate arguments. \
                    `spawn ["foo" "bar" "baz"]` is equivalent to `spawn "foo" "bar" "baz"`.

              The "primary selection" is a special clipboard that contains the text that was last selected with the mouse, and can usually be pasted with the middle mouse button.

              This is a feature that is not inherently part of the core Wayland protocol, but [a widely supported protocol extension](https://wayland.app/protocols/primary-selection-unstable-v1#compositor-support) enables support for it anyway.

              This functionality was inherited from X11, is not necessarily intuitive to many users; especially those coming from other operating systems that do not have this feature (such as Windows, where the middle mouse button is used for scrolling).

              If you don't want to have a primary selection, you can disable it with this option. Doing so will prevent niri from adveritising support for the primary selection protocol.

              Note that this option has nothing to do with the "clipboard" that is commonly invoked with `Ctrl+C` and `Ctrl+V`.

              Declare named workspaces.

              Named workspaces are similar to regular, dynamic workspaces, except they can be
              referred to by name, and they are persistent, they do not close when there are
              no more windows left on them.

              Usage is like so:

              ```nix
              {
                programs.niri.settings.workspaces."name" = {};

                };
              }
              ```

              Unless a `name` is declared, the workspace will use the attribute key as the name.

              Workspaces will be created in a specific order: sorted by key. If you do not care
              about the order of named workspaces, you can skip using the `name` attribute, and
              use the key instead. If you do care about it, you can use the key to order them,
              and a `name` attribute to have a friendlier name.

                    On most touchpads, tap and drag is enabled by default.

                    Tap and drag means that to drag an item, you tap the touchpad with some amount of fingers to decide what kind of button press is emulated, but don't hold those fingers, and then you immediately start dragging with one finger.

                    By default, a "tap and drag" gesture is terminated by releasing the finger that is dragging.

                    Drag lock means that the drag gesture is not terminated when the finger is released, but only when the finger is tapped again, or after a timeout (unless sticky mode is enabled). This allows you to reset your finger position without losing the drag gesture.

                    Drag lock is only applicable for devices where tap and drag is also enabled.

                  How windows in columns should be displayed by default.

                  Note that you can override this for a given column at any time. Every column remembers its own display mode, independent from this setting. This setting controls the default value when a column is *created*.

                  Also, since a newly created column always contains a single window, you can override this default value with ${link' "programs.niri.settings.window-rules.*.default-column-display"}.

                  When this is enabled, there will be an empty workspace above the first workspace, and you can go past the first workspace to get to an empty workspace, just as in the other direction. This makes workspace navigation symmetric in all ways except indexing.

                  The top and bottom struts are absolute gaps from the edges of the screen. If you set a bottom strut of 64px and the scale is 2.0, then the output will have 128 physical pixels under the scrollable working area where it only shows the wallpaper.

                  Struts are computed in addition to layer-shell surfaces. If you have a waybar of 32px at the top, and you set a top strut of 16px, then you will have 48 logical pixels from the actual edge of the display to the top of the working area.

                  The left and right structs work in a similar way, except the padded space is not empty. The horizontal struts are used to constrain where focused windows are allowed to go. If you define a left strut of 64px and go to the first window in a workspace, that window will be aligned 64 logical pixels from the left edge of the output, rather than snapping to the actual edge of the screen. If another window exists to the left of this window, then you will see 64px of its right edge (if you have zero borders and gaps)

                      If the final value option is not null, then its value will take priority over ${link' "programs.niri.settings.layout.default-column-width"} for windows matching this rule.

                      An empty attrset `{}` is not the same as null. When this is set to an empty attrset `{}`, windows will get to decide their initial width. When set to null, it represents that this particular window rule has no effect on the default width (and it should instead be taken from an earlier rule or the global default).

                      This does nothing if the window is not floating when it is created.

                      There is no global default option for this in the layout section like for the column width. If the final value of this option is null, then it defaults to the empty attrset `{}`.

                      If this is set to an empty attrset `{}`, then it effectively "unsets" the default height for this window rule evaluation, as opposed to `null` which doesn't change the value at all. Future rules may still set it to a value and unset it again as they wish.

                      If the final value of this option is an empty attrset `{}`, then the client gets to decide the height of the window.

                      If the final value of this option is not an empty attrset `{}`, and the window spawns as floating, then the window will be created with the specified height.

                      If the final value of this field is null, then the window will be focused based on several factors:

                      - If it provided a valid activation token that hasn't expired, it will be focused.
                      - If the strict activation policy is enabled (not by default), the procedure ends here. It will be focused if and only if the activation token is valid.
                      - Otherwise, if no valid activation token was presented, but the window is a dialog, it will open next to its parent and be focused anyways.
                      - If the window is not a dialog, it will be focused if there is no fullscreen window; we don't want to steal its focus unless a dialog belongs to it.

                      (a dialog here means a toplevel surface that has a non-null parent)

                      If the final value of this field is not null, all of the above is ignored. Whether the window provides an activation token or not, doesn't matter. The window will be focused if and only if this field is true. If it is false, the window will not be focused, even if it provides a valid activation token.

                      Whether to draw the focus ring and border with a background.

                      Normally, for windows with server-side decorations, niri will draw an actual border around them, because it knows they will be rectangular.

                      Because client-side decorations can take on arbitrary shapes, most notably including rounded corners, niri cannot really know the "correct" place to put a border, so for such windows it will draw a solid rectangle behind them instead.

                      For most windows, this looks okay. At worst, you have some uneven/jagged borders, instead of a gaping hole in the region outside of the corner radius of the window but inside its bounds.

                      If you wish to make windows sucha s your terminal transparent, and they use CSD, this is very undesirable. Instead of showing your wallpaper, you'll get a solid rectangle.

                      You can set this option per window to override niri's default behaviour, and instruct it to omit the border background for CSD windows. You can also explicitly enable it for SSD windows.

                      Also, note that the maximum height is not taken into account when automatically sizing columns. That is, when a column is created normally, windows in it will be "automatically sized" to fill the vertical space. This algorithm will respect a minimum height, and not make windows any smaller than that, but the max height is only taken into account if it is equal to the min height. In other words, it will only accept a "fixed height" or a "minimum height". In practice, most windows do not set a max size unless it is equal to their min size, so this is usually not a problem without window rules.

                      If you manually change the window heights, then max-height will be taken into account and restrict you from making it any taller, as you'd intuitively expect.

                      The `x` and `y` fields are the distances from the edge of the screen to the edge of the window, in logical pixels. The `relative-to` field determines which two edges of the window and screen that these distances are measured from.

              Debug options for niri.

              `kdl arguments` in the type refers to a list of arguments passed to a node under the `debug` section. This is a way to pass arbitrary KDL-valid data to niri. See ${link' "programs.niri.settings.binds"} for more information on all the ways you can use this.

              Note that for no-argument nodes, there is no special way to define them here. You can't pass them as just a "string" because that makes no sense here. You must pass it an empty array of arguments.

              Here's an example of how to use this:

              ```nix
              {
                programs.niri.settings.debug = {
                  disable-cursor-plane = [];

                };
              }
              ```

              This option is, just like ${link' "programs.niri.settings.binds"}, not verified by the nix module. But, it will be validated by niri before committing the config.

              Additionally, i don't guarantee stability of the debug options. They may change at any time without prior notice, either because of niri changing the available options, or because of me changing this to a more reasonable schema.

By using it, you are trusting me to not upload malicious builds, and as such you may disable it.

              If you do not wish to use this cache, then you may wish to set ${link' "programs.niri.package"} to ${nixpkgs-link "niri"}, in order to take advantage of the NixOS cache.

            Stylix integration. It provides a target to enable niri.

            This module is automatically imported if you have home-manager and stylix installed in your NixOS configuration.

            If you use standalone home-manager, you must import it manually if you wish to use stylix with niri. (since it can't be automatically imported in that case)

              Whether to style niri according to your stylix config.

              Note that enabling this stylix target will cause a config file to be generated, even if you don't set ${link' "programs.niri.config"}.

              This also means that, with stylix installed, having everything set to default *does* generate an actual config file.

          Configuration options for niri. This module is automatically imported by ${link' "nixosModules.niri"} and ${link' "homeModules.niri"}.

          By default, this module does nothing. It provides many configuration options for niri, such as keybindings, animations, and window rules.

          When its options are set, it generates `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/niri/config.kdl` for the user. This is the default path for niri's config file.

          It will also validate the config file with the `niri validate` command before committing that config. This ensures that the config file is always valid, else your system will fail to build. When using ${link' "programs.niri.settings"} to configure niri, that's not necessary, because it will always generate a valid config file. But, if you set ${link' "programs.niri.config"} directly, then this is very useful.

          a.variant = section ''
            ## type: `variant of`

            Some of the options below make use of a "variant" type.

            This is a type that behaves similarly to a submodule, except you can only set *one* of its suboptions.

            An example of this usage is in ${link' "programs.niri.settings.animations.<name>"}, where each event can have either an easing animation or a spring animation. \
            You cannot set parameters for both, so `variant` is used here.
