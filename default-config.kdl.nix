# This config is structured as KDL.
# This means, that the document is a tree of nodes.
#
# At the top of the config is a list of nodes. Each node has:
# - exactly one name, which is a string
# - zero or more ordered arguments, which are scalars
# - zero or more unordered properties, which are attrsets of scalars
# - zero or more ordered children, which are nodes
#
# KDL also permits "type names", but niri does not use them.
#
# Scalars are strings, integers, floats, booleans, or null.
#
# This default config uses the kdl library from https://github.com/sodiboo/niri-flake/blob/main/kdl.nix.
# It provides a set of functions to declare KDL documents.
#
# The fundamental function is `kdl.node`, which takes a name, a list of arguments, and a list of children.
# To declare properties, you should pass an attrset to `kdl.node` as the last argument.
#
# For your convenience, the following transformations are applied to the given parameters:
#
# - The arguments, if not a list, are wrapped in a list.
#   - This means that you can pass a single argument without wrapping it in a list.
#   - You can also pass properties directly, if there are no arguments.
#
# - The children are flattened, and any nulls are removed.
#   - This means that you can call functions directly in the children list.
#   - You can also create "conditional" nodes by setting them to null.
#   - You can see this feature used to the fullest at https://github.com/sodiboo/niri-flake/blob/main/settings.nix
#   - This transformation is also applied at the top-level.
#
# Additionally, kdl.nix provides some shorthand functions to omit the arguments list, children list, or both:
# - `kdl.plain` for nodes with no arguments
# - `kdl.leaf` for nodes with no children
# - `kdl.flag` for nodes with no arguments or children
#
# With that out of the way, here's the nixfied default config for niri.
